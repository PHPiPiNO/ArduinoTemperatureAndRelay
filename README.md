# Arduino Temperature And Relay

This sketch is designed for arduino nano and manage the DH11 temperature
sensor and a relay.

The relay is at pin 9 while the temperature sensor is at pin 12.

The temperature is returned as a string with informations abaout

* humidity
* celsius temperature
* celsius temperature indexed
* fehrenheit temperature
* fehrenheit temperature indexed
